# Overview

As a software engineer, I am exploring the Android ecosystem to understand how mobile applications are structured, built, and executed. This project is a foundational step in mastering the tools and languages required for professional mobile development, focusing on the core components of the Android platform.

This software is a "Hello World" Android application. It features a single activity that displays a visual greeting using an XML-based ConstraintLayout. The application demonstrates the bridge between UI design and logic by programmatically updating the displayed text using Kotlin when the app initializes.

My purpose for creating this software was to successfully set up a professional Android development environment, manage dependencies with Gradle, and understand the Android Activity lifecycle. It serves as a base for learning how to handle user interface elements and dynamic data manipulation.

# Development Environment

* **Android Studio**: The primary IDE used for designing the layout and writing the Kotlin logic.
* **Gradle**: Used for build automation and managing project dependencies.
* **Android SDK**: Targeted API Level 35 to ensure compatibility with modern Android features.

The programming language used for this project is **Kotlin**, chosen for its modern syntax, safety features, and official support as the preferred language for Android development.
